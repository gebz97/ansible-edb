# Database and user names containing spaces, commas, quotes and other
# special characters must be quoted.  Quoting one of the keywords
# "all", "sameuser", "samerole" or "replication" makes the name lose
# its special character, and just match a database or username with
# that name.
#
# ---------------
# Include Records
# ---------------
#
# This file allows the inclusion of external files or directories holding
# more records, using the following keywords:
#
# include           FILE
# include_if_exists FILE
# include_dir       DIRECTORY
#
# FILE is the file name to include, and DIR is the directory name containing
# the file(s) to include.  Any file in a directory will be loaded if suffixed
# with ".conf".  The files of a directory are ordered by name.
# include_if_exists ignores missing files.  FILE and DIRECTORY can be
# specified as a relative or an absolute path, and can be double-quoted if
# they contain spaces.
#
# -------------
# Miscellaneous
# -------------
#
# This file is read on server startup and when the server receives a
# SIGHUP signal.  If you edit the file on a running system, you have to
# SIGHUP the server for the changes to take effect, run "pg_ctl reload",
# or execute "SELECT pg_reload_conf()".

# Put your actual configuration here

#
# If you want to allow non-local connections, you need to add more
# "host" records.  In that case you will also need to make PostgreSQL
# listen on a non-local interface via the listen_addresses
# configuration parameter, or via the -i or -h command line switches.

# CAUTION: Configuring the system for local "trust" authentication
# allows any local user to connect as any PostgreSQL user, including
# the database superuser.  If you do not trust all your local users,
# use another authentication method.
